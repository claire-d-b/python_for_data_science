# Create and Use Virtual Environments
# venv (for Python 3) allows you to manage separate package installations
# for different projects. It creates a “virtual” isolated Python installation.
# When you switch projects, you can create a new virtual environment which
# is isolated from other virtual environments.

# Before you can start using the environment you need to activate it:
source venv/bin/activate

# get latest packages : pip (also known by Python 3's alias pip3) is a
# package-management system written in Python and is used to install
# and manage software packages.
