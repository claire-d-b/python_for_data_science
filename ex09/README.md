pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel

# Generate Distribution Archive
# This command will create a dist/ directory containing a .tar.gz file, which is your distribution archive.
python setup.py sdist
pip install ./dist/ft_package-0.0.1.tar.gz

# Generate Wheel Distribution
# This command will create a dist/ directory containing a .whl file, which is your wheel distribution archive.
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install ./dist/ft_package-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl

# Difference between both : standard source distribution archive sdist (cross-platform, Python compiles the code during installation) VS  binary distribution format called a wheel (faster installation, platform specific, skips the build step and directly unpacks the pre-built files)
