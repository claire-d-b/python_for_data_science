# CtrlC tells the terminal to send a SIGINT to the current foreground process,
# which by default translates into terminating the application.
# CtrlD tells the terminal that it should register a EOF on standard input,
# which bash interprets as a desire to exit.
# EOF is not a character (in most modern operating systems).
# It is simply a condition that applies to a file stream when the
# end of the stream is reached.
# The confusion arises because a user may signal EOF for console
# input by typing a special character (e.g Control-D in Unix, Linux, et al),
# but this character is not seen by the running program, it is caught by
# the operating system which in turn signals EOF to the process.

# In Python, __name__ is a special variable assigned to the name
# of the Python module by the interpreter. If your module is invoked as
# a script, then the string ‘__main__’ will automatically be assigned
# to the special variable __name__.
# But if you import your module into another module, the string
# ‘my_module’ will be assigned to __name__.
# When a module is invoked as a string, then Python interpreter will
# assign the string '__main__' to a special variable called __name__,
# and the code, which is defined under the condition
# if __name__ == ‘__main__', will subsequently get executed.
# On the other hand, when a module is imported in another module,
# then the Python interpreter will assign the string with the name
# of that module to the special variable __name__. This means that in
# such cases if __name__ == ‘__main__’ will evaluate to False which means that
# only the code outside of this condition will get executed once imported.
